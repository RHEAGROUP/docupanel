The User Properties can be accessed by clicking on the leftmost button on the ribbon control.

The user is able to set the following settings:

- **Language** - you can choose to set the user interface language to either English or French. **Warning**: It is required to restart the application to see the results.
- **Data Sources** - you can add your common data source addresses to this table. Once added, they become available in the Login panel so that you do not need to retype them every time. Click on the first row to add a new record. A record has a name, which allows you to identify it quickly and an address which should be a valid URL to the server that the connection should be made to. You can edit any row just by clicking at the cell that contains the information. If you select a row by pressing on the grey bar to the left of the **Name** field you can use the <kbd>delete</kbd> button on your keyboard to delete the record.
